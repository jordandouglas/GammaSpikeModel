      Pr(m): The probability this operator is chosen in a step of the MCMC (i.e. the normalized weight).
  Pr(acc|m): The acceptance probability (#accept as a fraction of the total proposals for this operator).

WARNING: Loggers appear to have different log frequency.
WARNING: This may cause problems in post-processing based on more than one log files.
WARNING: Therefore, it is recommended to use the same log frequency
Hint: note that TreeWithMetaDataLogger with dp="X" prints out trees with decimal places, potentially reducing tree file sizes substantially.
